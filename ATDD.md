# ATDD 

Acceptance testing, tests to see if the web app is working the same way a user would use the site. 

Acceptance (also end to end) can cover all scenarios from a users perspective. 

It is development methodology based on communication between business customers, developers and testers. 

Acceptance testing aids the developers and testers to think about the users needs before the implementation and writes the tests in language customers can understand. 

ATDD is closly related to TDD the difference is the collaboration and full communication through the important parties.
